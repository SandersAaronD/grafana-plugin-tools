# Set up development environment

We have chosen to use Docker for plugin development because it simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. It allows you to create consistent and isolated environments for your plugin. This makes it easy to manage dependencies and ensure that the plugin runs the same way across different machines.

With the `create-plugin` tool, the Docker container is configured with the necessary variables to allow easy access to Grafana and to load plugins without the need for them to be signed. The plugin tool also adds a live reload feature that allows you to make your frontend code changes to trigger refreshes in the browser.

import DockerNPM from '@snippets/docker-grafana-version.npm.md';
import DockerPNPM from '@snippets/docker-grafana-version.pnpm.md';
import DockerYarn from '@snippets/docker-grafana-version.yarn.md';

## Before you begin

Make sure you are using supported a supported OS, Grafana version, and tooling.

### Supported operating systems

Grafana plugin tools work with the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows 10+ with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Supported Grafana version

We generally recommend that you build for a version of Grafana later than v9.0. For more information about requirements and dependencies when developing with Grafana, see the [Grafana developer's guide](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md).

### Recommended tooling

You'll need to have the following tools set up:

- Go ([Version](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-tools/blob/main/packages/create-plugin/templates/backend/go.mod#L3))
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [LTS](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/) version of Node.js
- Optionally [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Choose a package manager

When you first run `@grafana/create-plugin`, choose your package manager: `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`.

## Set up Docker environment

The [`create-plugin` tool](../get-started/get-started.mdx) includes a development environment featuring [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It allows you to start an instance of the Grafana application for plugin developers against which you can code.

:::info

It's not necessary to [sign a plugin](../publish-a-plugin/sign-a-plugin.md) during development. The development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` will load the plugin without a signature.

## Get started with Docker

To start your plugin development project, run the following commands in the order listed:

1. <SyncCommand cmd="install" />: Installs frontend dependencies.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run dev" />: Builds and watches the plugin frontend code.
1. `mage -v build:linux`: Builds the plugin backend code. Rerun this command every time that you edit your backend files.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run server" />: Starts a Grafana development server running on
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Restart this command each time you run `mage` to run your new backend
   code.

### Configure the Grafana version

To test a plugin across different versions of Grafana, set an environment variable. Use `GRAFANA_VERSION` to set the Grafana version:

<CodeSnippets
  snippets={[
    { component: DockerNPM, label: 'npm' },
    { component: DockerPNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
    { component: DockerYarn, label: 'yarn' },
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

### Configure the Grafana image

The default Docker image in the plugin tool is `grafana-enterprise`. If you want to override this image, alter the `docker-compose.yaml` by changing the `grafana_image` build argument like so:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  grafana:
    container_name: 'myorg-basic-app'
    build:
      context: ./.config
      args:
        grafana_version: ${GRAFANA_VERSION:-9.1.2}
        grafana_image: ${GRAFANA_IMAGE:-grafana}
```

This example assigns the environment variable `GRAFANA_IMAGE` to the build arg `grafana_image` with a default value of `grafana`. This gives you the option to set the value when running `docker-compose` commands.
