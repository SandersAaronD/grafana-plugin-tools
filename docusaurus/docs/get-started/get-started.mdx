Grafana's plugin tools offer an officially supported way to extend Grafana's core functionality. We have designed these tools to help you to develop your plugins faster with a modern build setup and zero configuration.

The plugin tools consist of two packages:

- `create-plugin`: A CLI to scaffold new plugins or migrate plugins created with `@grafana/toolkit`.
- `sign-plugin`: A CLI to sign plugins for distribution.

## Before you begin

Ensure that your system, tools, and development environment are adequate for plugin development. For our recommendations, refer to [Set up development environment](./set-up-development-environment.mdx).

## Quick Start

To scaffold your plugin, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:

  <CodeSnippets
    snippets={[
      { component: ScaffoldNPM, label: 'npm' },
      { component: ScaffoldPNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
      { component: ScaffoldYarn, label: 'yarn' },
    ]}
    groupId="package-manager"
    queryString="current-package-manager"
  />

1. When prompted, enter answers to the given questions. For example:

  ```
  ? What is going to be the name of your plugin?: mongodb
  ? What is the organization name of your plugin?: grafana
  ? What type of plugin would you like?: datasource
  ```

  If you enter those values for name, organization, and plugin type, then the directory and plugin ID will be named `grafana-mongodb-datasource`.

  :::note

  If you have previously built a plugin with `@grafana/toolkit`, you can use our plugin tools to simplify migration. For more information, refer to [Migrate from toolkit](/migration-guides/migrate-from-toolkit.mdx).

  :::

## Output

Run the above command to create a directory called `<orgName>-<pluginName>-<pluginType>` inside the current directory. This directory contains the initial project structure to kickstart your plugin development.

:::info

The directory name `<orgName>-<pluginName>-<pluginType>` is based on the answers you gave to the prompts. Use the name of the generated folder when prompted.

:::

Refer to [Folder structure](./folder-structure.md) for a description of what you should expect to see.

## Prompts

When running the `create-plugin` command, the following prompts appear:

### What is the name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your plugin. This helps to identify its purpose.

### What is the organization name of your plugin?

Enter the name of your organization. Grafana plugins require an organization name (normally your [Grafana account](https://grafana.com/signup/) username) to help uniquely identify your plugin.

### How would you describe your plugin?

Give your plugin a description. This will help users more easily understand what it does when the plugin is distributed.

### What type of plugin would you like?

Select from the following choices:

- **app**: Create a custom out-of-the-box monitoring experience.
- **datasource**: Add support for new databases or external APIs.
- **panel**: Add new visualizations to dashboards.
- **scenesapp**: Create scenes applications or scenes plugins (that is, dashboard-like experiences in app plugins).

To learn more about the types of plugins, refer to the [plugin management guidelines](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/).
To learn more about scenes, refer to the [Scenes documentation](https://grafana.com/developers/scenes).

### Do you want a backend part of your plugin?

App and data source plugins can have a backend component written in Go. Backend plugins offer powerful features such as:

- Enable [Grafana Alerting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/) for data sources.
- Connect to non-HTTP services to which a browser normally can’t connect. For example, SQL database servers.
- Keep state between users. For example, query caching for data sources.
- Use custom authentication methods and/or authorization checks that aren’t supported in Grafana.
- Use a custom data source request proxy. To learn more, refer to [Backend developer resources](./introduction/backend-plugins#resources).

### Do you want to add Github CI and Release workflows?

Add [Github workflows](/create-a-plugin/develop-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows) to your development cycle to help catch issues early or release your plugin to the community.

### Do you want to add a Github workflow to automatically check Grafana API compatibility on PRs?

Add a [Github workflow](/create-a-plugin/develop-a-plugin/set-up-github-workflows#the-compatibility-check-is-compatibleyml) to regularly check that your plugin is compatible with the latest version of Grafana.
